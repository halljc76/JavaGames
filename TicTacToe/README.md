# JavaTicTacToe

This is a repository for a Java-based version of the board game TicTacToe!

These .java files work as a player-versus-CPU (random, no AI implementation) game of TicTacToe.
Implementing AI functionality (similar to Minimax and the repository "PythonTicTacToe"'s UnbeatableTTT.py) is a possibility for the future.
